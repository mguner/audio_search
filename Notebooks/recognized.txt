the question is what did the Archbishop.

why said the dodo.
Recognized Text From chunk_59
the best way to explain it is to do it.
Recognized Text From chunk_60
first it marked out a race course in a sort of Circ.
Recognized Text From chunk_61
and then all the party were placed along the course here in.
Recognized Text From chunk_62
there was no one to three and away but they began running when they liked and left off.
Recognized Text From chunk_63
so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
Recognized Text From chunk_64
however when they had been running half an hour or so and we're quite dry.
Recognized Text From chunk_65
I don't know suddenly called out the race is over.
Recognized Text From chunk_66
and they all crowded round it panting and asking who has one.

Recognized Text From chunk_72
pointing to Alice with one fee.
Recognized Text From chunk_73
and the whole party at once crowded around her calling out in a confused way.
Recognized Text From chunk_74
crazy surprises.
Recognized Text From chunk_75
Alex had no idea what.
Recognized Text From chunk_76

half afraid that it would be a.
Recognized Text From chunk_90
mine is a long and sad tale said the.

turning to Allison son.
Recognized Text From chunk_92

poor Alice began to cry.
