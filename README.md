# audio_search
Use speech_to_text for keyword search in audio files.

## Further Research

- We can improve keyword search. 
- Right now silent detection is mechanical (We give the minimum dFBS number and min_silence parameters by hand). Unfortunately, this leads that for each chapter, we should find the best parameters. It might be very interesting to see ML solving this problem. 
- Instead of keyword search for some book context search might be interesting.
